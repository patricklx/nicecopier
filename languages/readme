Download language-template.ts and edit it with QT Linguist
http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/Qt+Linguist+Download?content=89360


If you edited it, you can test it by releasing it 
and copying the generated file to 
{NiceCopier folder}/languages and it will 
automatically appear in the settings dialog


feel free to send it to me so i can upload it.

I also intend to update the website to allow uploading language files :)
